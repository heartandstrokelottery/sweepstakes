        <h2>5. Use, disclosure and retention of personal information</h2>
        <p>Your personal information will not be used without your consent for purposes other than those for which it was collected or in accordance with applicable laws. From time to time, we may wish to use personal information for new or additional purposes, in which case we will amend the Privacy Policy to include these new or additional purposes and will obtain your consent through your continued use of our Services.</p>
        <p>We retain your personal information only for as long as we need it to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and to comply with our legal obligations.</p>
        <p>We may also use and disclose your personal information to third parties under the following limited circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>to provide you with Services, we may use service providers, data processors and other third parties (“Third Parties”) to perform services on our behalf and to help with Heart & Stroke’s operations and Services including, without limitation, for customer services, monitoring and analyzing Site activity, marketing services, data hosting services and operating and maintaining the Site. Service providers and partner companies may only use your personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</li>
          <li>when necessary to protect the safety, property or other rights of Heart & Stroke, its representatives, and users of the Services, including to detect and protect against fraud.</li>
          <li>if we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets to a related company or a third party. Your personal information will remain subject to any pre-existing privacy policy unless you agree to the privacy policy of the company or third party that acquires your personal information.</li>
          <li>with your consent; or</li>
          <li>when otherwise required or permitted by law.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you voluntarily submit or post any information, photographs, or other content to any Heart & Stroke forums, eTools, X (formerly Twitter), Facebook pages or other social networking pages/sites, your personal information may be automatically included in the posting, including without limitation, your username and email address. This information may be collected and used by others.</p>
        <h2>6. Data processors in other countries</h2>
        <p>Heart & Stroke and its Third Parties may store, process, and transfer personal information on servers located outside of your province of residence in jurisdictions whose data protection laws may differ from those of Canada or your province of residence, which may include the United States of America.  As a result, personal information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those jurisdictions according to the laws in those jurisdictions. For example, information may be shared in response to valid demands or requests from government authorities, courts, and law enforcement officials in those countries. Subject to applicable laws in such other jurisdictions, we will use reasonable efforts to ensure that appropriate protections are in place to require our Third Parties to maintain protections on personal information that are equivalent to those that apply in Canada.</p>
        <h2>7. Links to other sites</h2>
        <p>The Site may contain links to other websites or Internet resources, notably those belonging to our sponsors, partners, or collaborators. When you click on one of those links you are contacting another website or Internet resource that may collect information about you voluntarily or through cookies or other technologies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices, or the content of any sites owned and operated by any third parties. Other sites may collect and treat information collected differently, so we encourage you to carefully read and review the privacy policy of each site you visit.</p>
        <h2>8. Providing credit card information on our site</h2>
        <p>If you make a credit card payment through Heart & Stroke, we request the information reasonably needed by us to complete the processing of the transaction. For one-time payments, when you provide payment information, such as credit card numbers, credit card security codes, name on your credit card and expiration dates, we transmit this data directly from you to the credit card processing company; Heart & Stroke only stores the credit card type, the last four digits of the credit card number and the expiration date in the event an incorrect payment needs to be refunded. Heart & Stroke will send you a confirmation email to confirm successful credit card charges. For pre-authorized debits for recurring payments, all information is stored by Heart & Stroke or Third Parties acting on our behalf, in an encrypted manner (i.e., coded data) such that only those who require access to update financial information can see the credit card number. The encrypted data is provided at the appropriate intervals to the credit card processing company. We may also share your personal information with Third Parties including credit card processing companies to bill you, but we do not provide any more information than reasonably necessary for this purpose.</p>
        <h2>9. Cookies and online tracking tools</h2>
        <p>As you interact with our Services, we may use automatic data collection technologies that record and collect information to identify your computer, track your use of our Site, and gather other information about your browsing habits.

        <p>A cookie is a small data file placed on your computer’s hard drive so that your computer will “remember” information when you visit a site. Web beacons and tags are small strings of code used with cookies to record activity on our Site. Internet tags and graphic tags count users who visit a page or access certain cookies. These technologies allow us to personalize the Site and improve your experience. We may also include web beacons in HTML-formatted emails to determine which emails were opened.</p>

To protect your privacy, we use Google Analytics’ "Anonymize IP" function, which processes IP addresses in shortened form to prevent direct identification.</p>

        <h2>13. Security</h2>
        <p>To help protect the confidentiality of your personal information, Heart & Stroke employs security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information. We maintain reasonable technical, physical, and administrative security safeguards to protect your personal information against loss, theft, and unauthorized access. Any personal information you provide to us is exchanged on a secure server. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we are committed to protecting your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us.</p>
