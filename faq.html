              <p>The Heart and Stroke Lottery never asks winners to pay to claim their prize. If you're told to pay, contact our customer service at (647) 391-4881. To avoid lottery fraud, keep a list of the lotteries you've entered and ask anyone who says you've won to tell you exactly when and where you entered. Remember, in Canada, you don’t have to pay fees or taxes to get your prize, so don’t trust anyone who asks for money. Make sure emails come from ontarioheartandstrokes.ca@gmail.com, not from places like Yahoo or Gmail. If you get mail, check for the official letterhead and make sure the address matches the one on our website. Also, look out for bad spelling or grammar, as real messages from us are always well-written.
